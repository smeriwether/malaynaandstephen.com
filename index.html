      <h2>How We Met</h2>
    </header>

    <p class="md:text-normal text-sm leading-6">
      While pursuing their dreams in New York City, Stephen and Malayna met
      working at healthcare start-up. During the many lunches and dinner parties
      Malayna and Stephen spent time getting to know each other.
      In this time together, they shared many special moments that laid the
      foundation for their relationship. After Malayna received her MCAT score
      and her acceptance to the University of Rochester, Stephen was the first
      person she shared her excitement with. On quiet afternoons, Stephen looked
      forward to the chats they had when Malayna returned for client meetings.
      Even when Stephen was called away to join another consulting team, they
      stayed in touch and looked forward to seeing each other at the next get together.

      <h2>Our First Date</h2>
    </header>

    <p class="md:text-normal text-sm leading-6">
      In the midst of COVID, Stephen met Malayna at the airport
      so that she wouldn't have to brave the Post- apocalyptic NYC alone after
      weeks spending in Arizona. Stephen took Malayna to his favorite pizza shop
      in Greenpoint, Paulie Gee's, and they spent the evening catching up while
      looking over the East River at Transmitter Park, which quickly become
      their go-to spot. They spent the rest of the summer meeting up in
      the park to explore the city, have long talks, and eat the best food
      before Malayna had to leave to Rochester for medical school.

      <h2>The Proposal</h2>
    </header>

    <p class="md:text-normal text-sm leading-6">
      After countless summer and fall weekends hiking with their dog, Pepper, and taking
      photos, Stephen's plan began to take shape. He knew he needed to choose
      the timing carefully - the proposal would have to be between clerkships,
      after the big exam was over, in order for Malayna to fully enjoy the
      moment. So on November 5, 2022, they packed up for yet another hiking
      adventure and headed off to Ithaca, where they frequently took day trips and
      weekend getaways. Once they arrived at Treman State Park, Stephen was on the
      look out for a perfect spot. He'd told Malayna the he wanted to take family
      photos, and sneakily distracted her with the task of scoping out a “better view of the
      waterfall” while he got set up. Instead of setting the timer, Stephen pressed record and
      called Malayna and Pepper back over. Rather than turning and smiling for the
      camera, Stephen burst in to a speech that he'd been practicing for
      weeks. Although initially confused, Malayna quickly realized what was
      happening. With Pepper watching on, Stephen got on one knee and asked
      Malayna to marry him. Of course, unable to control her excitement, she
      said yes!
