      Hi ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to our wedding website, I can't believe our wedding is only ${Math.round(Math.abs(weddingDate - today) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000))} days away!.

      If you're wondering how I built this site, I have good news, it's open source! Take a look at
      the site on Github here: https://github.com/smeriwether/malaynaandstephen.com.

      Enjoy the rest of your ${weekdays[today.getDay()]}.
